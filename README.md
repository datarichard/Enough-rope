## The current and future impact of COVID-19 on suicide rate in Australia

###### Suicide rates in Australia are not increasing with distress levels in the population

There is much uncertainty around the immediate and long term impacts of
the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) on suicide mortality in Australia.
There is little evidence from previous pandemics as to their effects on
suicide rates, and modelling has produced a wide range of results
reflecting this uncertainty [(Tang et al 2020
Insight)](https://insightplus.mja.com.au/2020/29/covid-19-and-suicide-variation-and-response/).
Historically the suicide rate has changed over time in Australia as
social, economic and environmental factors influence suicide risk. Such
trends have provided useful information on instrumental factors, such as
restricting access to means of suicide and reducing the risks posed by
social or economic factors such as job loss. However the economic impact
of COVID-19 also differs from previous economic downturns as it
represents a disruption to supply rather than reduced demand. Given
these novel conditions, the emerging empirical data on the current
situation serves as a valuable indicator to inform our response.

**Impact of social and economic events on suicide rate**. The highest
annual age-standardised rate for males in the last century occurred in
1930 (29.8 deaths per 100,000 population), during the Great Depression—a
period of high unemployment, particularly among males. The rise in both
male and female suicide rates in the 1960s has been attributed, in part,
to the unrestricted availability of barbiturate sedatives [(Oliver &
Hetzel 1972;
Whitlock 1975)](https://www.aihw.gov.au/suicide-self-harm-monitoring/data/deaths-by-suicide-in-australia/suicide-deaths-over-time).
Subsequent falls in these rates in the late 1960s and early 1970s have
in turn been attributed to restrictions to the availability of these
drugs in July 1967 (AIHW: Harrison & Henley 2014). Likewise, rates of
suicide by use of firearms declined steeply for both males and females
from 1987 after the introduction of gun control restrictions in some
states of Australia, and fell further after additional reforms in 1996.
High rates of suicide in the late 1980s and early 1990s coincided with a
period of economic uncertainty in Australia.

**Recent trends in psychological distress have been increasing**. Given
the commonly observed association between psychological distress and
suicide among individuals, we might expect that the general level of
psychological distress in the community is a good indicator of the
suicide rate as well. For instance, population-estimates of
psychological distress act as a final mediator in one widely
acknowledged model, which predicts up to a 50 percent increase in the
suicide rate in the next two years in Australia (Atkinson ref).

A widely-used indication of the mental health and wellbeing of the
Australian population is the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale
[(K10)](https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/kessler_10_manual.pdf).
The K10 questionnaire was developed to yield a global measure of
psychosocial distress, based on questions about people’s level of
nervousness, agitation, psychological fatigue and depression in the past
four weeks.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) estimates the psychological
distress levels for the Australian population from the *National Health
Survey*. The ABS reports representative estimates of the population with
“low”, “moderate”, “high” or “very high” levels of psychological
distress. Here we describe the proportion of people reporting some level
of distress (i.e., greater than “low”) by calculating the complement of
the proportion reporting “low” levels of distress
(*P*<sub>distressed</sub> = 1 — *P*<sub>low</sub>). This has the benefit
of using the largest proportion with the smallest associated error.

In 2012 (the first year for which data is readily available online), the
proportion of distressed people, i.e., those reporting some level of
distress greater than “low”, was estimated at 29.9 (±0.8) percent, but
this increased to 39.2 (±1.1) percent by 2018, a difference of over 9
percent and well outside the 95% confidence limits. The proportion of
distressed young people has also increased from 38.1 (±2.6) percent in
2012 to 50.9 (±3.8) percent in 2018, a difference of 12.8 percent which
is also well outside the 95% confidence limits.

<br>

Thus distress levels have increased rapidly in Australia in the recent
years for which data is available, in young people as well as across the
population as a whole.

<br>

**Recent trends in suicide rates have been relatively steady**. Since
2012, the overall suicide rate has increased from 11.2 (10.8-11.7 95%
CI) to 12.1 (11.6-12.5 95% CI) deaths per 100,000 in the population in
2018. This represents a difference of almost 1 percent however the 95%
bounds provided by the ABS overlap, indicating any increase may be
insubstantial. The suicide rate for young people (aged 18-24) has
increased from 5.9 to 7.6 in 2018 (no confidence intervals are provided
for this smaller subset), a difference of 1.7 percent.

<br>

Overall, an increase in suicide over this period is hard to detect.
Among total suicides, where as many as 3,046 suicides were recorded in
2018, no statistically significant increase is apparent. Some increase
is apparent in the 18-24 age group, however the numbers in this subgroup
represent approximately a tenth of the total (*n* = 358), making
reliable inference more difficult. This contrasts with the clear
increase in psychological distress in the community in recent years
noted above. It seems likely that other factors, such as economic
conditions, access to means etc are likely to play a larger role in the
trend in suicide rates in the last ten years than the general distress
levels in the community.

**A Victorian case-study**. Victoria, along with the rest of Australia,
successfully reduced COVID-19 cases to negligible levels by early June
(as few as 3 new cases a day according to the 7-day trailing average,
www.covid19live.com.au). However a second wave forced the State
government to shut borders and reintroduce severe lockdown restrictions
across Melbourne and surrounding regions in early July (July 7th). A
state-of-disaster was declared on August 2nd with increased restrictions
for at least six weeks. This makes Victoria a good case-study to examine
the early impact of lockdown on community distress levels and suicide,
relative to its historic trend or contemporaneous trends in other states
(QLD data may be available in a week).

**The Facebook COVID-19 symptom data**. In partnership with University
of Maryland (and Carnegie Mellon University), global Facebook users,
including Australian users, were invited to take off-platform surveys to
self-report COVID-19-related symptoms, and the data were made available
as part of the [The COVID-19 Symptom Data
Challenge](https://www.symptomchallenge.org). Every day, a new
representative sample of Facebook users over 18 years old was invited to
consent and participate. Sampled users received the invitation at the
top of their News Feed and the surveys were conducted off the Facebook
app by the academic partner. Participants reported on COVID-19 symptoms,
social distancing behavior, financial constraints, and psychological
distress. (<https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/view/7761>)

Indicators for nervousness, depression, and anxiety, adapted from the
K10 scale (Kessler et al. 2003), were collected as part of the survey.
The survey data is provided in granular but aggregate form (i.e., no
response-level or person-specific data). Facebook provided
regionally-specific weights to reduce nonresponse and coverage bias in
age and gender. The total number of responses in the sample used here
(Victoria, Australia) was *N* = 70,607.

<br>

**Victorian Suicide Data**. Monthly suicide data was provided by the
[Victorian Coroner’s Court Monthly Suicide data
report](https://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-10/Coroners%20Court%20Suicide%20Data%20Report%20-%20Report%202%20-%2005102020.pdf)
summarising the number of suicides per month between January to
September 2020, published on October 5th.

<br>

**Suicide in Victoria did not change with the proportion of people
reporting depression in 2020**. The monthly tally of suicides in
Victoria shows a slightly declining trend over the time period, from *n*
= 63 in January to *n* = 49 in September. By contrast, the proportion of
people reporting depression increased from 43.2 percent in May to 53.6
percent in September (blue), an increase of over ten percent.

<br>

Thus the estimated proportion of reported depression in Victoria
increased, while we did not observe concomitant increases in the
incidence of suicide. Instead, suicide tended to diverge from depression
over the lockdown period.

**Conclusions**. The dissonance between the decline in mental health and
the incidence of suicide, particularly notable for a lack in young
people where massive rises have been predicted, has several possible,
and not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanations and inferences:

1.  Suicide rates are a poor indicator of the community’s mental health,
    an inference supported by the observation that rising rates of
    mental distress in young people in Australia over the past few years
    have not been matched by increases in the suicide rate
2.  Suicides result from a complex interplay with many very proximal
    factors including access and substance use. Counterintuitively the
    lockdown in Victoria may have reduced access to these and we may see
    a post lockdown increase in the suicide rate
3.  The huge uncertainty in predicting rare events has not been
    reflected in the modelling, some of which assumes a change in mental
    health as the mediating pathway, and results in high predictions.
    The total excess suicide deaths across 53 countries (accounting for
    78 percent of Europe’s population, and 88 percent of the population
    in the Americas - nearly a billion people) was 4884 (95% confidence
    interval 3907 to 5860) in the year after the GFC. Predictions of a
    median excess number of suicides of c.1500 per year in Australia
    with a population of just 24 million seems comparatively excessive
    but only time will tell.
